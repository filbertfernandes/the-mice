# the-mice
A video game inspired by Chrome's Dino Runner. Avoid the running mouse, shoot the mouse, choose your character, and turn on the light when it's dark!

This is a modified code from KnifeCircus' tutorial on YT, you can check the tutorial here:

There are still some bugs in this game that need to be fixed.
- You can't pause the game anymore after you lost. (âœ“ FIXED)
- When you pause the game, the score system is still running.
*I added a code where if you pause the game, your score is going back to 0. And when you start the game again after you paused, your score also going back to 0. Need a better code tho.
